# MovieBookingAlert

This Project was created when I needed to keep a tab on when the booking for the most awaited movie: "Avengers: The End game" was released

The show timings and bookings for each day would be addedabetween 10:30 and 11:30 am and it was close to impossible to be glued to the booking site since I had to work.

I used python and the concepts of web scraping and pattern matching using regular expressions to scan the booking site for the specific details:
1. Movie Name
2. Date of the show
3. Theatre closest to me

This short code is easy to learn and understand why we need programming and how it can be fun!

**#To Run**

Run the python script via the command prompt
python bookmyshow.py

update the following lines per the movie, date and theatre preference: line 9 and line 21

NOTE: this is specific for the site Bookmyshow.com
